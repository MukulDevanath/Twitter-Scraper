# Twitter-Scraper
Twitter is a social media platform having Trillions of data, when we need to analyse the data we cannot copy and paste all those data so We use SNSCRAPE python package.

This is my project of getting data like Tweets, date, id, url, tweet content, user,reply count, retweet count, language from Twitter using a Keyword or Hashtag that is present in the Twitter systems.

I have used Streamlit to create the webpage, and Snscrape to Extract the data from Twitter.

We can view all the information of the tweets, analyse all the details, and download it to our system if required.
